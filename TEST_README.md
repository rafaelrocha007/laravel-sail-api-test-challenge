## PHP Engineer

Dear Candidate,

First, we are happy you get this far on our hiring process, congratulations. We believe that interviews are probably not the best place to test the coding skills of a promising candidate. We created this little challenge for you to show your coding skills. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

This little challenge was created in a way to give you maximum freedom so that you can show us the best of your expertise. Roughly you have up to two weeks to send it in.

## The Task

We'd like you to create a simple REST API, which provides information about customers. You are supposed to follow the constraints right below:

1. Create a command/script to import the [`customers.csv`](customers.csv) file into your database;
2. Create two extra fields for latitude and, longitude and, fill them up by customer's address using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro);
3. Implement a REST API with two endpoints: one for listing all customers and, another one for getting a single customer by its `id`;
4. Write instructions on how to get your code up-and-running.

### Bonus

You will gain bonus points for:

1. Write tests (Feature/Unit);
2. Create an SPA to consume the REST API;

Note 1: _We kindly ask you not to publish your implementation, to avoid online spoilers._

Note 2: _We expect you to use Laravel 8+ and Laravel Passport._

# Our review

The focus of the review is on answering some questions such as:

- How clearly can you separate concerns in your code?
- Are SOLID principles violated?
- How good have you designed your models? Do they make sense?
- Are your docs clear?
- Does your code follow PSR coding style recommendations?
- Does your solution contain any dead/redundant code?
- Does your application launch?
- Does the application do what it promises?
- Can we find bugs or minor flaws?
- Did you provide a complete product ready to deploy?

The following things most probably not impress us:

- Overengineering;
- Implementing additional features;
- "Fat" controllers;
- Using global variables;
- Typos, grammar mistakes in a variable naming.

Extra points for:

- Docker;
- One-command setup;
- Well written documentation.

That said, good luck and happy coding! ;)
